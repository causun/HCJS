    <h1>BRIARDSW</h1>
    <h3>By Ivy Duckett</h4>
    <p>The briard, or erger de brie, is a large breed or dog traditionally used as a herfer and guardian of sheep. </p>
    <h2>Breed History</h2>
    <p>The <b> briard</b>, which is believed to have riginated in France, has been bred for centuries to herd and to <br>
    protect sheep. The breed was used by the French Army as sentries, messengers and to search for <br>
    wounded soldiers because of its fine sense of hearing. Briards were used in the First World War almost <br>
    to the point of extinction. </p> 
    <p>Currently the popo;ation of briards is slowly recovering. <i>Charlemagne, Napoleon, Thomas jefferson and <br>
    lafayette</i> all owned briards.</p>
